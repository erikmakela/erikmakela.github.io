>Now we see a different temperature profile. The air is colder than 0 deg C aloft where snow forms, but then warms to just above freezing in a small layer. In this layer, the falling snow partially melts so that the precipitation is now partly snow and partly water. As it continues to fall toward the surface where cold air again exists (temperature below freezing), the precipitation refreezes to form sleet or ice pellets.
