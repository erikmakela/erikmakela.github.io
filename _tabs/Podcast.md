In my car I either do two things - listen to podcast or listen to nothing and think. I mostly am either informing myself on recent credit card Churning activities or getting a laugh or two in. I follow very few individuals as I find it more fun to go through the backlog of people's publishing's rather than jump around to many different podcasts. 

So what do I reccomend?
