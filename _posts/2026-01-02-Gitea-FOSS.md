Gitea is a lightweight, self‑hosted Git service built in Go that offers a simple, drop‑in alternative to larger platforms. It lets teams keep code, issues, and CI pipelines on their own servers without unnecessary complexity.

- One‑file installation that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Native issue tracking, project boards, and wiki all within the same interface.
- Easy integration with external CI/CD tools and support for Git LFS.
