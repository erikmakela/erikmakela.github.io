For our open-source spotlight this FOSS Friday, I want to highlight QOwnNotes, a versatile note-taking application.

Here are a few aspects of QOwnNotes I find particularly useful:
*   It uses plain text files with Markdown support, ensuring future-proof access to your notes.
*   It integrates flawlessly with Nextcloud's Notes app for seamless synchronization across devices.
*   Scripting support allows for extending functionality.
