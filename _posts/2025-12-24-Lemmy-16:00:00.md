Happy FOSS Friday! Today's featured project is Lemmy, a self-hosted, federated social link aggregator and discussion platform, serving as a compelling open-source alternative.

Here are a few things that set it apart:

*   It's decentralized design is based on ActivityPub, allowing users to interact with multiple, interconnected communities.
*   Users can create and moderate their own communities, tailoring the platform to their specific interests.
*   Its open-source nature allows for community contributions, modifications, and transparency.
