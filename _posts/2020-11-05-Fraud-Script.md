**Joke Script for a Video I never made**

I've have had the consumeristic need for useless stuff lately

one problem, I'm broke, and being irresponsible at the age of redacted, I don't have any money Because of this I have decided to look up to the greatest minds in Washington (starts to print money)

Alright I just came back from Walmart. It seems as (they) though Walmart doesn't want to accept my genius for reasons of "counterfeit" and federal crime

I think their just jealous

So that was a failed idea. On to the next. I've been hearing a lot of press on tax fraud lately, maybe I'll give that a try. I've heard it saves you a lot of money.

It's been a few days now and I just got a letter from the IRS. The 'I'm really smart' agency. It's probably to congratulate me for my well thought out financial technique.

Ah sh*T
