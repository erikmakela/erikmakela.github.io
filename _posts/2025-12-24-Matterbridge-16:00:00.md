For this week's Free and Open Source Software Friday, I want to shine a light on Matterbridge!

Matterbridge is a messaging bridge that allows you to interface between various messaging platforms.

*   It supports a wide array of protocols, helping connect disparate communication tools.
*   Offers flexible configuration options, catering to numerous bridging needs.
*   Allows for the creation of custom bridges with its robust bot API.
