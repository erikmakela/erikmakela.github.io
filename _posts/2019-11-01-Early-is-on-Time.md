You know what really grinds my gears? The phrase early is on time, on time is late, and late is unacceptable. No on time is one time.

The reason is because this phrase was not used properly in my time during boy scouts.

Whenever I would clean up my tent and area I would be the first one done. While it's a nice thing to help others out and get their tents setup it was extremely annoying to help the people that were purposely slow or just had a later start schedule to me.
I would be the first one to finish yet the one to help almost everyone.
**I was disincentivize from being early because being early meant more work**

However, when it comes to showing up to appointments it is extremely nice to be early. I have taken this to such an extremely that now I can leave a 10-minute buffer in my schedule and that buffer would almost always be used for either relaxing before an event or preparing more for whatever was going to happen next.
