I love Battlefield 2142 the game. I fully believe it is the best game that enbodies the principles of [asymetric desing.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRG9GrNFxIY)

Here’s a better formatted list for people that are playing a 10+ year old game.

#### All Loading Screen Tips and Tricks Tutorial for Battlefield 2142 | BF2142 Tutorials

(0) You don't need this if you are a pro just ultra noobs. Any time during play, you can customize your kit. The changed equipment will be in your inventory on next spawn.  
(1) When you are playing as a squad, you will see the Field Upgrade Bar in the upper-left corner. When this is full, squad members are eligible to select a Field Upgrade.  
(2) Field Upgrades are temporary unlocks. Once unlocked, these can be used as long as you stay on the server.  
(3) The three Squad Leader Unlocks can only be used by Squad Leaders. Anyone can unlock them, but only Squad Leaders with a squad of a certain size are allowed to use them.  
(4) The five player ability unlocks can be unlocked as any other weapon or item. The difference is, once unlocked they are always equipped and not a part of the customization.  
(5) On the Kit Customization screen - you can choose between light or heavy body armor. The heavy armor reduces the sprint capacity, so it's not all good with more protection.  
(6) When you are promoted during a round, you can choose the unlock at the End of Round or - if you are in a hurry to get back to the fighting - wait and do this later on in BFHQ.  
(7) Do not forget to check out the training film on the Titans. The film will guide you through the tactical information on the Soldier HUD, the rules of the battle, and provide valuable tips on how to best bring down the enemy Titan.  
(8) Anytime during a round, you can press ESCAPE to get to the menu. Once you are done, just press ESCAPE again and you will return to the fight.  
(9) Getting recommended for badges, ribbons and pins will help your Soldier's progress up in rank.  
(10) Watch out for those Sentry Guns support troops can deploy. You do not want to get too close before finding out if they were deployed by friendlies or enemy troops.  
(11) You do not have to choose an unlock right away. Your unlock credits will be available in the Unlocks section of BFHQ.  
(12) The Leaderboards in BFHQ show the best of the best. They can be filtered to show just your buddies, players from your country, or to only show the players you have dog tags from.  
(13) The graph showing your stats progress in BFHQ will also predict your upcoming performance based on your recent efforts.  
(14) Several awards can be achieved multiple times and they help you go up in rank.  
(15) You can join a server your Buddy is playing on by pressing the join button, in the expanded Buddy List.  
(16) When you knife kill someone, you get their dog tags. Snipers all over - beware.  
(17) Some unlocks are not items but permanent upgrades to either kit or soldier.  
(18) The Gruber 5 Scope Stabilizer unlock helps you settle your rifle drift as a sniper. Unlock it and pick off those dog tag collectors more easily.  
(19) The A12 Enforcer Sentry Guns will scan the area for enemies. Tactically used they can be very effective in guarding important areas or paths.  
(20) Commanders and Squad Leaders can give orders by using the context sensitive communication rose (default on 'T'). Just aim at a strategic spot and send the order.  
(21) Look out for drones as a good way of spotting a Squad Leader. Be sure to spot them before they spot you.  
(22) Sentry Guns can be destroyed by firing at them. Or why not take them out with a well-placed EMP grenade?  
(23) The enemy Titan giving you and your teammates a hard time? Do not forget that the weapon systems on the Titan exterior can be destroyed.  
(24) EMP is an effective way of temporarily disabling vehicles. An EMP mine will do the job faster than the EMP grenades. Sneaky people are known for hijacking vehicles this way.  
(25) A sniper who aims at the head will be more successful than the one that goes for the easy body shot.  
(26) If you run out of ammo your sidearm can be a lifesaver. Do whatever it takes to keep your dog tags.  
(27) The away bonus will help you get back on track with your career after some R&R. But the fastest way to go up in rank is to earn it on the battlefield.  
(28) Any kills following your Squad Leader's attack or defend orders will generate a bonus score.  
(29) If you see a "2" next to a player's name, this means they are veterans from Battlefield 2(TM). So, either be extra careful around those vets, or go after them extra hard to welcome them to the future.  
(30) Which weapon is the Voss L-AR? Read more about it in BFHQ Unlocks or on the Kit Customization screen.  
(31) You can have up to four (4) Soldiers with their own persistence per EA Account. If you would like to create a fifth Soldier, you will have to delete an existing Soldier first.  
(32) Field Upgrades are only rewarded to soldiers in squads. This is one of the many reasons squad play might be the way to go, if you want the best experience.  
(33) The NetBat system allows soldiers in the same squad to share information on enemy locations.  
(34) Use the Squad Leader Bacon together with scrambled eggs for a nutritious breakfast for all of your freshly spawned squad.  
(35) The Squad Leader Spawn Beacon allows squad members to spawn in on tactical locations. However, soldiers will be dropped in pods, so it is not the most stealthy spawn.  
(36) Titan Commanders should be careful to avoid putting their Titan directly over a missile silo, as it will hit their Titan even if it was aimed for the enemy.  
(37) Squad Leaders will climb the ranks faster if they have a habit of issuing tactically correct orders. The same is true for Commanders.  
(38) Squad members will gain from carrying out their Squad Leaders' orders. Each kill while following orders will count in the pursuit of the next rank.  
(39) The Commander score is determined by the individual team members' scores. And if the Commander leads the troops to a victorious round, there will be an additional bonus.  
(40) Do not forget to customize your kits. Your last configuration will be saved.  
(41) APCs have seats equipped with launch pods, which provide an excellent way of getting aboard the Titan.  
(42) If you experience motion sickness during play, set Camera Shake OFF in the Options.  
(43) Each kit has two separate unlock branches, which both lead to a new weapon. Go wide if you want a little bit of everything, and go deep if you more quickly want to unlock a new main weapon.  
(44) Your skill in combat and the support of your fellow troops will - together with the awards you receive - add to your experience and help you climb the ranks.  
(45) Don't forget you can pick up fallen soldiers' kit equipment. They might have more unlocks than you, and this is an excellent way to try them out.  
(46) Field Upgrades are an excellent way to try out unlocks before you unlock them permanently.  
(47) Squad members will gain from carrying out their Squad Leader's orders. Each kill while following orders to attack or defend gets the squad one step closer to a Field Upgrade.  
(48) Healing, reviving and rearming your fellow squad members - and repairing their vehicles - will give you points and also help your squad getting a Field Upgrade.  
(49) When you play a Co-op game, any number of friends can join the game up to the 16 player limit. When someone joins, a bot will be kicked out of the game.  
(50) When you play a LAN game or a Singleplayer game - as long as you are connected to the Internet you will be able to use the items and weapons you have previously unlocked.  
(51) Active Defense can be used on most vehicles to protect you from incoming missiles and rockets. You'll have to use it carefully as it only lasts for a few seconds and takes a while to recharge.  
(52) Boost is available on the fast attack vehicles - use it to get out of those nasty situations in which only speed can save you.  
(53) Vehicles have different armor values in different locations. For example, many vehicles have less armor in the rear than in the front. Try to keep this in mind when you go up against other vehicles.  
(54) You cannot armor everything - some vehicles have inherent weak spots which have less armor and are more vulnerable to fire from more types of weapons.  
(55) APCs have assault pods which can be used to launch into combat. When launched, you can control their flight using the standard movement keys.  
(56) Weapon accuracy varies depending on your stance, movement and whether you are zoomed. Practise with each weapon so that you understand its strengths and weaknesses.  
(57) Not all weapons are created equally - they are designed to be good at different ranges and conditions. Practise with each weapon to learn more about its strengths and weaknesses.  
(58) Infantry can equip themselves with light armor which allows them to sprint further and recuperate from a sprint faster. However, light armor provides less protection.  
(59) Visual disturbances and electronic sounds might be signs of a Recon soldier using the IT-33 Active Camouflage in your immediate vicinity. Use an EMP grenade to reveal them.  
(60) The Networked Battlefield is your squad's best friend. Look at an enemy unit and you will pass information such as the type of enemy to the rest of your squad.  
(61) When in a squad, watch for the Networked Battlefield icons in your 3D HUD. These icons indicate that someone in your squad is viewing or engaging an enemy and you can move into a supporting position.  
(62) Different infantry types can provide different functions for the Networked Battlefield. Each infantry type has its own speciality. Practise with your squad members to get the best use out of the system.  
(63) Networked Battlefield icons appear anywhere a squad member has made contact with the enemy. Just because you see the NetBat icon doesn't mean that the enemy is in your visual range.  
(64) When using the Scope Stabilizer unlock, be sure to hold the 'SHIFT' key (default) down in order to use it effectively.  
(65) You can set the range at which a rifle rocket explodes. When in zoom mode roll the mouse wheel to set the detonation range. When fired, the rocket will auto-explode at the preset range.  
(66) The smoke grenade is a highly effective tool for the assault soldier. It provides excellent cover during an attack in tight quarters and is especially useful during a Titan boarding.  
(67) The PDS-1 unlock allows the engineer infantry to fix the position of enemy vehicles. Place it to cover known routes and it will update you and your squad via the NetBat.  
(68) The AE Defuser unlock allows Engineer infantry to remove explosive devices. Keep an eye out for the enemy who set the explosive as they may be using it to bait you.  
(69) The II-29 Motion Mine unlock is the latest generation of anti-vehicle explosives. They will actively track on moving enemy vehicles and follow until they make contact and explode.  
(70) The DysTek Pulse Meter is a short-ranged reconnaissance tool which will identify any enemy units in range. The information will be passed on to each squad member via the NetBat.  
(71) EMP can be used to stop a vehicle in its tracks as well as hinder their ability to track and engage opponents. While the effect is temporary it is still very effective in making vehicles vulnerable.  
(72) Can't move your vehicle? Is your HUD showing discharge and visual glitches? You've just been EMPed. Your options are to wait until the effect passes or get out of the vehicle.  
(73) EMP can affect infantry by causing their advanced helmet optics to experience temporary visual glitches.  
(74) The IPS Shield unlock is the perfect tool for providing cover when necessary. It blocks small arms fire but vehicle munitions will penetrate it easily.  
(75) The IPS Shield unlock can block most bullets. However, if you aim at the control box you can disable it. It takes a skilled rifleman to shoot the small target.  
(76) The SLSB unlock is only available to the squad leader. It allows the squad leader to place a spawn point on the map. The beacon can be seen and destroyed by opponents.  
(77) The DysTek Pulse Meter can fix the position of enemy squad leader beacons. Use it when you suspect a beacon has been placed nearby.  
(78) The RD-4 Otus is a squad leader unlock. It functions as a recon drone identifying enemy units within range. The information is passed on to the squad via the Networked Battlefield system.  
(79) The SD-8 Accipiter is a squad leader unlock. It will target and engage enemy infantry which appear within its target acquisition field. Extremely useful for watching the squad's back.  
(80) Even with no or few unlocks you can activate or deactivate your heavy armor, on the Customization screen.  
(81) The two icons to the left of the soldier in the Customization screen are the HUD and kit upgrades that you can unlock.  
(82) Make sure you check these game tips during load since they do change.  
(83) From the in-game scoreboard, you can invite other players to your Buddy List. Go to the Manage tab of the scoreboard to send a request to a specific player.  
(84) If you hit an opponent there will be a small white indicator around your crosshair to help you. If you never see this, you might want to adjust your aim.  
(85) When you are getting hit by incoming fire there will be an indicator that lights up in the direction of the threat. So, spin around and get even.  
(86) Spawning in from a squad leader beacon will put you inside a drop pod. Be sure to have a quick look around on your way down so you know of possible threats. They will no doubt see you coming.  
(87) Despite what people might tell you in the chat or over VoIP; pressing Alt and F4 at the same time is not a way to get an unlock in this game.  
(88) In the Awards section of BFHQ, you can see what criteria there are for each awards and your progress towards them.  
(89) Don't forget to add your friends to your Buddy List. This way, you can always see if they are online and which server they are playing on.  
(90) Short-winded? Fatigued easily? Need cardio? Get more points and unlock the two sprint ability unlocks. One gives you longer sprint distance and the other one faster recovery.  
(91) When you receive a Buddy Message in a round you will get a notification on the HUD. To read and reply to the message, press ESCAPE to go to the menu.  
(92) In the Titan game mode, you can check the time left until a missile silo launches, by pressing the 'T' (default) key.  
(93) As the Titan Commander you can put your mouse cursor over your Titan, in your Command interface, to check its movement path.  
(94) As the Titan Commander you can place your mouse pointer over a missile silo, in your Command interface, to see the flightpath for that missile.  
(95) The Titan under your command can affect quite a large area around it. Try and find the best position on the battlefield to help support your ground forces.  
(96) As the commander, your job is to settle for nothing less than total victory. Therefore your score is based solely on the performance of your team. You will also receive a substantial bonus for winning.  
(97) In the Titan game mode, APCs and Air Transports are also spawnpoints.  
(98) As a squad Leader, or commander, you can place orders on many Networked Battlefield icons; by putting your crosshair over the icon, hitting the 'T' key and choosing Issue Order.  
(99) Some of the ranked servers are Rank Restricted. Only players with the first 10 ranks can join games on these servers.  
(100) Only a set number of players can have the three Top Officer ranks at the same time. And there can only be one Supreme Commander.  
(101) The drones help you as a squad leader but if they are activated in the wrong place they can give away your position.  
(102) Hitting the vehicles' soft spots will help you bring them down faster.  
(103) The DysTek Hi-Scope x4 unlock enhances your sniper rifle with some extra zoom possibility.  
(104) The 3D map can be switched on and off using the corresponding key. When it is enabled, you will see all the information made available by the Networked Battlefield (NetBat) system.
