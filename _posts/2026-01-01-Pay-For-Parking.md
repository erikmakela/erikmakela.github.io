I've been towed twice over the past two years. I'm writing this down because I want to convince myself fully to just pay for the cheap cost. Using I my handy dandy finance knowledge it comes in handy to quantify using time-value-of-money calculations.

## Option 1: Pay For Parking

- Payment = $125 per year (25 parking per year * 5)
- Interest = 3.5%
- Number of years = 2 years
- Future Value (what I would pay at the end) = 0
- Present Value (what I pay now) = ?

## Option 2: Be A Dummy And Get Towed

- Payment = $160 per year
- Interest = 3.5%
- Number of years = 2 years
- Future Value (what I would pay at the end) = 0
- Present Value (What I pay now) = ?

## What should you do?

- Opportunity Cost Option 1 =-$237.46 (This is better)
- Opportunity Cost Option 2 = -$303.95 (This is bad)

## Don't be a dummy, Pay for Parking.
