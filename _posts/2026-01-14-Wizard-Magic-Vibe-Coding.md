I finally decided to boot back up my main desktop computer and try out some of the new "AI Coding Assistants" to see what they are capable of. The extensions [Cline Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=saoudrizwan.claude-dev) & [Roo code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline) do this by having a model interface with an IDE. With a [local model](https://localai.io/) you can even do the process fully offline. And with I made 2 simple tools. One was for query the GitHub API to get a list of my GitHub stars and the other was to make a semi-automated video editor.

My mind has gone from "gahh, I have to figure all this stuff out to make this program" to "oh, I'm done. Now what else can I add?". Of course, there is going to be the eventual time when the project gets too complex and I'll have to study an entire generated code base or start from scratch. But I don't think I'll ever get there (yet). Most of the tools I'm making now have a few primary purposes and objectives that have either been proprietary software or have a lackluster solution on GitHub.
I fully believe that for the majority of non-developers a GUI (graphical-user-interface) is the main thing stopping people from trying a piece of software out.

Well guess what, now nobody has an excuse of "well that will take a lot of time to make it interactive, just use terminal".

Prompt: "Make a GUI and Debug any problems". Essentially done. It doesn't even have to look pretty, just usable and doesn't break. And if you don't want it in the main code base? Separate it out.

So yeah, I get it now. I have been on the wire trying to figure out what cool stuff I can do with these new tools and sets of constraints. And while I still fully believe software developers will be needed (at-least in the short term) I can only see the positives of letting more people with more ideas make application that gives a solution to their problem.
