A message sent by my instructor during a difficult time of the season.
> So round 3 of the same problems for the day.  Exact behavior that ruins every bit of your marching and playing.  So st this point I can't even think of a single reason y'all even bother with the activity.  Each one of you thinks your better than the next person and definitely NOT the problem ...AND THATS THE PROBLEM.  You're either the cut up or the person enabling the cut up.  We can't get our feet together cause we never start together.  We can't hit our direction changes or even stand a chance guiding cause we never stop together musically or visually.  We don't guide,  we don't even listen to understand how to guide.  We just wander around the field aimlessly thinking we're right and everyone next to us is wrong.  and Marching technique?!? What's that...other than not worth your time. And it all really comes down to selfishness and zero care for anyone other than yourselves as individuals.  The battery? The percussion section? The band?  No it's just a group of individuals faking it.  We bicker and fight and throw each other under the bus or generally talk down to one another.  How is that ever supposed to work?!? It's all about HELPING each other, by bringing each other up and teaching each other how to March and play and helping each other know where to be when there's a momentary lapse in paying attention...or a reminder to not talk and look/listen for direction. But no...I don't get it.  Have fun learning drill tomorrow...I mean, I have no clue how that's gonna work given you didn't learn where to start or how to fix facing or how to get off the boxes...and the list just continues.  I honestly don't know why I bother.  From here on out just play the page and march the dot.  Y'all figure out how to make it good.  Or figure out how you're going to convince me to come back
