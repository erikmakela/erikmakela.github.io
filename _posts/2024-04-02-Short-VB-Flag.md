My name is Erik Makela and I propose to lead a new initiative to redesign the flag of Virginia Beach (VB). With the number of tourists in 2022 towering to 13.6 million visitors, I find it peculiar that this part of the city's design has not been updated since the date of our original seal in 1963 (_Virginia Beach, 2023; Virginia Beach, n.d._).

**[Back in 2015 a YouTube video labeled 'Why city flags may be the worst-designed thing you've never noticed by Roman Mars' list an example of poorly designed city flags - with Virginia Beach prominently at the middle-bottom of a TED talk viewed by over 5 million people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pnv5iKB2hl4) (Image 1)**

To be straight forward - a seal on a flag is the prominent loss of an even greater symbol for the city.

While our city seal is amazing our current flag design is lacking. I position that:

- VB's flag design is poor and in violation of principle 4 of good flag design - No Lettering or Seals. "In most cases, a city flag should represent the entire city, not just the government. Thus, city-wide symbolism is preferred over a city seal or a city logo (government symbols)" (2022 New American City Flags Survey, n.d.).
- Out of 150 flags ranked by the North American Vexillological Association (NAVA - the organization of flag scholars) poll in 2004 VB places 125<sup>th</sup>, Norfolk 116<sup>th</sup>, and Chesapeake 69<sup>th</sup> out of 150 flags (_Flag Surveys_, n.d.).
- VB's tourist position can leverage a new flag design for increased revenue, recognition, and civic pride.

Hence, these points necessitate the need for a new flag design.

"Often, city leaders say we have more important things to do than worry about a city flag. My response is: If you had a great city flag, you would have a banner for people to rally under to face those more important things" (TED, 2015. 16:11; Kaye, 2006). A well-designed flag can be seen as an indicator of how a city considers all its design systems. Consider the American flag; It might seem frivolous, but it's not.

Multiple case studies can be referenced from NAVA members that have successfully implemented new designs with the help of a special committee (Case Studies in Flag Design, n.d.). All previous redesigns have given a re-consideration of what the city is and what it has become; while garnering tremendous community involvement during the process. With sites such as [SpeakUpVB](https://www.speakupvb.com/), the process would be seamless for our city to implement competitions and opinion polls.

Some individuals have an American flag flying outside their homes. It shows that they are proud of the country that they are in and the design behind the flag. We can do the same for Virginia Beach citizens showing their civic pride. By updating our flag, we're not just making a symbolic gesture; we're making another statement about Virginia Beach's commitment to staying relevant and forward-thinking. It's time to update Virginia Beach's flag. By doing so, we are joining over 300 other cities in revitalizing their identity (2022 New American City Flags Survey, 2022).

Thank you for your time,
