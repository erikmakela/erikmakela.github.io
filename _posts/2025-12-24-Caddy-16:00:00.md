Here's a look at Caddy, a powerful, enterprise-ready, open source web server that automates HTTPS.

*   It offers automatic HTTPS certificate management, getting and renewing them for you.
*   Its configuration is simple, relying on the Caddyfile format.
*   It handles many complex web server tasks out of the box, like load balancing and reverse proxying.
