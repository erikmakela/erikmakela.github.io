Alright, here's a LinkedIn post draft highlighting Solidus for FOSS Friday:

Kick off your e-commerce platform dreams with Solidus, a powerful, open-source framework built on Ruby on Rails.

Here are some reasons why I think it’s a great pick:

*   Benefit from a modular architecture, letting you select the exact features your store needs and extend functionality seamlessly.
*   Enjoy complete control over your codebase and data, allowing for deep customization and integration with other systems.
*   Leverage a vibrant and supportive community, providing ample resources and assistance for your development journey.
