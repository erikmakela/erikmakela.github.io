## Recipe

0\. Make in small quantities, does not taste as good when leftover

1\. Sweat chopped Onions, Carrots with Butter, Salt, and Black Pepper

2\. Introduce vegetable broth

3\. Slow boil chopped cabbage, zucchini, tomato chunks, potatoes, and small quantity of broccoli

4\. Wait until desired texture is reached

## Script for a video (I forgot like half the ingredients, lol)

Alright today we are going to making some vegetable soup

To get started just grab your cabbage and give it a nice drop

Then just put the cabbage in a bowl

Next thing you want to do is grab some carrots, give em a nice toss

Opps, let's try that again

Just a toss

There we go, also put them into a bowl

Then grab some zucchini and give it a nice chop

Also just put that into a bowl

Then we are going to grab some scallions I used these because I forgot we had onions

Give them a nice slice

Moving on to the broccoli, just use the force I would advise trying this on smaller vegetables first

Then we move on to a yellow zucchini

Oh,oh, one second, it's giving me some trouble

There we go, now just slice it up

Then there is the onion, it just exists, don't worry about it

Then we want to grab a pot, put heat on to medium-high, add some oil

Once the oil is heated up you want to add the scallions, onions, and carrots to simmer

Once you have waited for a little, add the broth

Then the final step is to add the rest of the vegetables including cabbage, broccoli, and zucchini

Also, I forgot to add diced tomatoes and potatoes I would recommend adding them otherwise the soup will taste not so pleasant, and add salt and pepper to your desire

And that's how to make vegetable soup
