1. Always be skeptical, if you are set on a position always check to make sure the evidence and logical consistency backs you up
2. No matter how much intelligence you gain, always believe you are stupid because when you think you are too smart this is when you fall into traps
3. If you have a question about anything, look it up
4. Never stop questioning
5. Always try to gain more knowledge even if boring to do so, it will develop good habits
6. Never block out one side of an argument
