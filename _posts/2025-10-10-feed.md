> If you look at a “clean” code summary and pull out the rules that actually affect the structure of your code, you get
> - Prefer polymorphism to “if/else” and “switch”
> - Code should not know about the internals of objects it’s working with
> - Functions should be small
> - Functions should do one thing
> - “DRY” - Don’t Repeat Yourself

> So by violating the first rule of clean code — which is one of its central tenants — we are able to drop from 35 cycles per shape to 24 cycles per shape, impling that code following that rule number is 1.5x slower than code that doesn’t. To put that in in hardware terms, it would be like taking an iPhone 14 Pro Max and reducing it to an iPhone 11 Pro Max. It's three or four years of hardware evolution erased because somebody said to use polymorphism instead of switch statements.
