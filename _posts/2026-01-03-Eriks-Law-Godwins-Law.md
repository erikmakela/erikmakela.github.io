Erik's Law: "The tendency for any conversation related to technology to turn into ai discussion"

This law is within the same vein of Godwin's law that states that "As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches one".
If restated word-for-word in Godwin's terms the law would describe that "As an online discussion grows longer, the probability of utilizing or involving AI, LLMs, or Neural Networks approaches one".

AI is the extreme to which a human process can be replicated by a machine. Or in another sense, it is the extreme to which the human creative process can be abstracted into a perfect set of definitions, structure, and output of that found within code.

I'm using AI in the general sense in regard to Neural Networks or Large Language Models.

Here are some examples for how a conversation would unfold under the law:

- Cars > Self Driving Cars > Image Detection > AI
- Computers > Electricity Cost > Data Centers > AI
- Digital Task Automation > Digital Process Automation > AI agent automation
- Proof Reading > Grammar Correction > Sentence and Structure Correction > LLMs > AI
- Biology > Protein Structures > Alphafold > AI
- Media Creation > Text-to-Speech, Speech-to-Text, Image Generation, Video Generation > AI
- Food > Chef Robots > Robotic Automation > AI
- Therapy > Therapy Tuned LLM Models > AI
- Social media > Recommendation Algorithms > AI
