This idea originally came from watching a video by [Luke Smith](https://lukesmith.xyz/). The essence of the matter being - **the internet in its current state is more centralized than decentralized in most consumer facing websites, leading to you being a product**. What I mean by 'censor everything' is that by taking people's creation away from them they would realize they actually have little control over the applications they use. This is one of the reasons why besides security [I self-host my own password manager and file storage](https://yunohost.org/). They are two of the most important pieces of data in which having someone else be the primary caretaker of. For example, I am still ok with backing up encrypted data to a cloud server.

## What are the problems? What are the solutions?

- Any Social Media Censors you? Host your own - [Fediverse & Simon Willison's Mastodon](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/5/mastodon/)
- ISP censors you? [Start your own - this is extremely difficult and one of the main barriers to a decentralized web](https://startyourownisp.com/)
- Website get shut down? [Get a better one](https://njal.la/)
- Blocked from downloading files? Torrent it

## What about illegal stuff?

It already exists on the dark web. There is nothing stopping you today other than the insanely obvious implications morals, ethics, and laws to explore the less tasty side of an open information ecosystem.
