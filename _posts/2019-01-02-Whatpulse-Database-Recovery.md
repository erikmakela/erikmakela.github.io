I wrote this for myself for when my computer would occasionally crash or blue screen and my data from https://whatpulse.org/ would get corrupted.

- type in %localappdata%  
- then go to whatpulse  
- right click on whatpulse.db  
- go to properties  
- then press Previous Versions  
- then recover

It’s a good software but I wouldn’t recommend it now as I prefer open-source alternatives. There is currently nothing similiar to it but with how easy it is to vibe code today I plan on making an alternative soon. If anyone wants to make it I’m putting a $100-$200 bounty on the app to support the development.
