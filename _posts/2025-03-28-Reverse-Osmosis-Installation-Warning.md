Do not use a drain line adapter or check value for a reverse osmosis filter system. I did this for a few months and indirectly caused a health hazard because of dishwasher backflow. Propper locations for where to put the drain valve are linked - [APEC Systems](https://pdf.lowes.com/productdocuments/652547cc-7c42-4db3-b6b1-aed824206477/10387407.pdf#page=17), [General Electric](https://pdf.lowes.com/productdocuments/ecb46c8b-0dc5-4334-a170-a2e16f291365/69835941.pdf#page=12)

How this came come my radar: [Will gravity be an issue for this dishwasher drain tube adapter?
