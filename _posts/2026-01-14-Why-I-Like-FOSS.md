## I have amassed more than 500 github stars. Why?

We have come to a point in time with software where it is extremely easy for most simple problem to be coded (with the use of coding assistants) and the marginal amount of effort to make them are significantly low. An ideal world and following the logic to its end is a world is software can be customized to an individual and still have a widescale use. I don't believe we are anywhere near that world but definitely one step towards it.

FOSS is a world in which people can solve their problems and others can then find software and modify it for their needs and contribute to it to being a final better product. In the world of Machine Learning, [a leak of Meta's llama model lead to the creation of a model within 2 months that competed with OpenAI's ChatGPT](https://newsletter.semianalysis.com/p/google-we-have-no-moat-and-neither)

A world of open software, just like a world of open knowledge exponentially increases the amount of individual experimentation and customization that will occur. Leaving everyone off with to then use "the next best thing" to make the "next bester/greatest" thing.
