Happy FOSS Friday, everyone! Today I want to put a spotlight on a great open-source tool to watch media remotely with friends.

Metastream lets you synchronize media playback across different devices, enhancing virtual watch parties.

*   Its core function allows for shared control, letting anyone pause, play, and skip at the same time as everyone else.
*   Offers broad platform support, being compatible with websites like Netflix and YouTube as well as local files.
*   The software has an easy to use interface and integrates cleanly with web browsers making setting it up straightforward.
