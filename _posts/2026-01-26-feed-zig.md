>To show what this looks like, I built an [interactive Cesium visualization](https://attron.github.io/astroz-demo/) that propagates the entire active catalog from CelesTrak (~13,000 satellites) across 1440 time points (a full day at minute resolution). That's ~19 million propagations completing in about 2.7 seconds. Add ~0.6 seconds for TEME→ECEF coordinate conversion, and you get a full day of orbital data for every tracked satellite in about 3.3 seconds.
