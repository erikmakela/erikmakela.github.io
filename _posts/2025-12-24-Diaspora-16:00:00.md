For this week's Free and Open Source Software Friday, I'm excited to share about Diaspora, a privacy-focused social network.

Diaspora distinguishes itself with:

*   Decentralization: Your data isn't held by a single corporation; it's spread across independent servers ("pods") you choose.

*   Privacy Controls: Fine-grained control over who sees your posts, with the ability to share different content with different groups.

*   Open Source Transparency: The code is open for anyone to review, ensuring accountability and community-driven development.
