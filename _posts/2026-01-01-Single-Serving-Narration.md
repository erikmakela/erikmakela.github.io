You wake up at O'Hare.

You wake up at SeaTac.

Pacific, Mountain, Central.  Lose an hour, gain an hour.  This is your life, and it's ending one minute at  time.

You wake up at Air Harbor International.

If you wake up at a different time and in a different place, could you wake up as a different person?

Everywhere I travel -- tiny life. Single-serving sugar, single-serving cream, single pat of butter.

Microwave Cordon Bleu hobby kit.

Shampoo/conditioner combo.  Single-serving mouthwash, tiny bar of soap.

The people I meet on each flight --they're single-serving friends. 

Between take-off and landing, we have our time together, but that's all we get.

You wake up at Logan.

On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero.

I'm a recall coordinator.  My job is to apply the formula.  It's a story problem.

A new car built by my company leaves somewhere traveling at 60 miles per hour.  The rear differential locks up.
The car crashes and burns with everyone trapped inside.  Now: do we initiate a recall?

Take the number of vehicles in the field, (A), and multiply it by the probable rate of failure, (B), then multiply the result by the average out-of-court settlement, (C).  

A times B times C equals X...

If X is less than the cost of a recall, we don't do one.

"Are there a lot of these kinds of accidents?"

 Oh, you wouldn't believe.

"... Which... car company do you work for?"

 A major one.
