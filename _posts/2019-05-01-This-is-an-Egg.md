This is an egg. At first you don’t care about the egg and say “hey that’s a cool egg”. Overtime you start experimenting on the eye figuring out a way to crack it. You try many different methods slowly learning about the egg, but still not caring much about the egg. One day you learn how to crack the egg, this gives you the greatest satisfaction you have ever gotten, so you continue and you keep getting better at cracking the egg until it’s basic muscle memory. But then one day you get distracted and you don’t focus so much on cracking the egg. After a while you stop cracking the egg. Soon after you start seeing other people cracking the egg at the same or faster speed then you. So, you think to yourself “why not try to crack again”. You go to crack the egg, but nothing happens, you always knew how to crack the egg but all of a sudden you have no idea anymore how to crack that egg. You then look at the other people doing it more effectively and efficiently getting frustrated that you can’t crack the egg like you used to. This gives you an immense feeling of disappointment.

There are two options to take after this road. One, you shall give up in cracking the and say “I will never be as good as them, I used to be, but I am not any longer”. Or two, you shall be patient and relearn how to crack the egg slowly but over time knowing you might be as fast as you used to. This is the very frustrating path, and few succeed but patience is the key and with it and enough time you can get to doing anything.

I originally made this as an analogy when I recently forgot some [__Algorithms__](https://ruwix.com/the-rubiks-cube/rubiks-cube-patterns-algorithms/) to solve a Rubix Cube 3×3.
