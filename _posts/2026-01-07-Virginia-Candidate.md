## **Building Your "Universe" (How You Get to 51%)**

Every campaign starts with defining the universe of voters you need to win.

- Your universe = **who votes in this election**, not everyone who lives there
- Two levers determine your path:
  - Turnout: getting your people to actually vote
  - Persuasion: convincing undecided or soft voters to choose you
- Winning is about math, not vibes. Know how many votes you need and where they come from

## **Voter Data in Virginia**

- Virginia Democrats use **NGP VAN (Voter Action Network)** to manage voter data
- VAN data is accessed through or purchased via the party and is essential for:
  - Targeting doors and mail
  - Tracking support
  - Building turnout plans
- Even in non-partisan races, **party data is often the best available data**

## **Picking a Camp (Even in Non-Partisan Races)**

Local races may be non-partisan on the ballot-but they are not neutral in practice.

- You need a base of support early
- Choosing a "camp" gives you:
  - Access to voter data
  - Volunteers
  - Endorsements
  - Credibility
- For Democratic-leaning candidates:
  - Build relationships with the **local Democratic Committee early**
  - Show up before you ask for anything
  - These relationships matter long before filing day

**Key takeaway:**  
You don't win local races alone and you don't win them without data.

## **What Elected Officials Actually Do (By Level)**

### **Federal (Congress / Senate)**

- Vote on federal legislation
- Constituent services with federal agencies
- Oversight of federal programs
- National policy focus

### **State (General Assembly / Statewide)**

- State laws and budget
- Education, transportation, public safety policy
- Oversight of state agencies

### **Local (City Council / School Board)**

- Land use, zoning, development
- Schools (School Board)
- Local budgets and taxes
- Public safety funding
- Infrastructure and quality of life issues

**Rule of thumb:**  
Local voters expect **problem-solvers**, not ideologues.

## **Critical Virginia Campaign Basics (Know These Early)**

### **Filing & Petitions**

- Filing deadlines typically fall **spring to early summer** for November elections
- Many local offices require **petition signatures** to qualify
- Signatures must be:
  - From registered voters
  - In the correct district
  - Submitted by the deadline (no grace period)

### **Campaign Finance (Virginia-Specific)**

- Virginia has **no limits on contribution amounts**
- All contributions and expenses must be reported to the **Virginia Department of Elections**
- Early fundraising matters-it signals seriousness and viability
- You will need:
  - A campaign bank account
  - A treasurer
  - Timely and accurate reporting

## **Timing & Viability**

Before running, you should be able to answer:

- Is there a realistic path to victory?
- Who is voting in this election?
- Is turnout favorable, or stacked against me?
- Do I have a base, or can I build one?

**Right time + right seat + right environment = opportunity**

## **How Local Campaigns Actually Communicate**

At the local level, **mail still matters-a lot**.

- Mailers are one of the most effective ways to reach voters in low-turnout elections
- Most campaigns rely on:
  - Professional mail firms
  - Targeted voter lists
  - Repetition, not one-off pieces
- Digital helps, but **mail wins local races**

## **First Concrete Next Steps**

Before committing, do these things:

- Talk to 10-15 voters who consistently vote in local elections
- Attend local committee and civic meetings
- Meet with the local Democratic Committee leadership
- Draft a one-page "Why I'm Running"
- Learn the filing and petition deadlines for your specific office

## **If these steps energize you, that's a good sign.**
