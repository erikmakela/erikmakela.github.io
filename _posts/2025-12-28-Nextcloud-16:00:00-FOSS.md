Nextcloud is an open‑source platform that lets you host your own private cloud for file storage, sharing, and collaboration. It keeps your data under your control while offering the same convenience you expect from commercial services.  

- **End‑to‑end encryption** that protects files both at rest and in transit.  
- **Built‑in collaboration tools** such as calendars, contacts, and real‑time document editing.  
- **Extensible app ecosystem**, enabling you to add features like video conferencing or project management without leaving the platform.
