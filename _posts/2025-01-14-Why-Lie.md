Say you were an expert of ice cream detection. Look at this bowl of chocolate ice-cream and say "that's vanilla ice-cream". Does it make sense? No. Is it easy to say? Yes.
Now say you want to lie about every color of ice cream in the ice cream shop. Do you remember what you called the chocolate ice cream? The vanilla ice cream? The mint ice cream?

Over time other people are going to detect that you are lying and have no idea what you're talking about when it comes to ice cream flavors. It's going to take more and more mental effort for you to keep track when you have lied about a specific ice cream flavor and why.

Everyone lies to some extent to another and that's where the term "little white lie" comes from, because sometimes it's easier to tell the truth than to not tell the truth. However, by not telling the true you are emotionally taxing yourself over time by creating a world in which you are unable to express what is true. And when tell the truth cost you? You are living in a world where you are trying to cover your tracks and one in which the consequence to your actions are not actualized. By lying you are living in a fantasy.

Why lie? Because if you do, you don't grow and are unable to show who you truly are.
