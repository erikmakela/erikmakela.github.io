For this week's FOSS Friday, I'd like to bring attention to Tiny Tiny RSS, a self-hosted news feed reader.

*   It allows you to aggregate and read your news feeds from one central location, keeping you organized.
*   It has extensive filtering capabilities, so you only see content that you care about.
*   Its open API allows for easy integration with other services.
