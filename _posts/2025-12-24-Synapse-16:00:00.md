Here's a quick look at Synapse for this week's Free and Open Source Software Friday!

Synapse is a decentralized communication platform, facilitating secure and open conversations.

*   It provides end-to-end encryption, ensuring private communication between users.
*   Synapse enables users to host their own server, giving them control over their data and communications.
*   It supports interoperability with other Matrix-based clients, fostering a federated network.
